# Flutter

In this project, we use Flutter - an open source UI toolkit from Google to build the frontend part of the app for the following reasons:
- Flutter supplies a rich set of Material Design and Cupertino (iOS) widgets to build beaut√¨ful UI.
- Flutter helps us build the mobile app for both main mobile platforms - Android and IOS from a single codebase that saves us lots of time and effort and Flutter app's performance is almost on par with the native app.
- We build the backend part of our app based on Firebase which can be integrated easily to Flutter-written app using the plugins supplied by Google.

## [Widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets-intro)

Widgets are pieces of the user interface. Flutter uses a variety of widgets to deliver a fully functioning application. These widgets are Flutter's framework architecture.

Widgets are generally defined in 2 main types:
- Stateless widgets: The widgets acts like constant view, only display the information and cannot be interacted with the user.
- Stateful widgets: The widgets contains internal states so that it allows the interaction between user and application.

In our app, we mostly use the statefull widgtets to build all main screens.
