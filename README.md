# Introduction
- Etoet is a location tracking application that allows users to make friends
with others and track their location using the "add friend" feature. 
- Users can also text and access personal information about their friends through the app, such as their email addresses and phone numbers. 
- The app also allows users to broadcast an SOS signal to others to receive 
assistance with private and public modes, giving them more options for 
getting help in an emergency.

# Motivation
In the context of the raging Covid pandemic, many people were, unfortunately, 
quarantined, leading to not being able to go out to buy essential items, Zalo 
has updated a feature to help these people call for help from the community. 
With this in mind, our team devised the idea to create Etoet by combining this 
feature with Zenly - another friend location tracking app. If there is enough 
room for development, this app could become a tool for users seeking assistance 
with health and security issues. Authorities will be able to locate the person 
in need of help more quickly and easily.
